<h1 id=header2>HOW TO PUSH YOUR WEBSITE:</h1>

<ol id=list2>
	<li>Open terminal</li>
	<li>[cd ./desktop/sebastianm-t-d.github.io]</li>
	<li>[git add .]</li>
	<li>[git commit -m "INSERT MESSAGE"]</li>
	<li>[git push]</li>
</ol>

<h1 id=header2>First Journal Entry. </h1>

<ol id=list1>
	Today I put my website online using github and the terminal. It was a little confusing and I made several mistakes along the way, but it's done now. Now I have a website I can fill with all my mediocre CS projects :)
</ol>

<h1 id=header2> Second journal entyr. </h1>

<ol id=list1>
	Today I made my contact card thingy for my website to put on the CS website. So now I can be found by my classmates and the like. I decided to use a picture of a chimpanzee using a computer, because that's really how it be sometimes. For some reason the goons at new lab think it's a good idea to block all images and all websites that could possibly be useful.
</ol>

<h1 id=header2>Third journal ent.r</h1>

<ol id=list2>
	Today I am pushing my website, and I have produced some bad CS projects that are now, theoretically, on the site. I did an animation. And also I'm working on this weird skull code thingy that will eventually be cool. Go check it out.
</ol>

<h1 id=header1>Entry 5</h1>

<ol id=list1>
	Today I'm pushing my website (for real this time), and I also put my projects on my projects page. I added a back button on both projects and on this journal, which is beautiful and glamorous, and you should click it once you're done reading this wisdom. Uhh, that's it. Once I'm done uploading this I'll continue working on my jumpscare, I think. Or maybe the skullcode thing. toodles!
</ol>

<h1 id=header1>Entry 6 -- Home Page</h1>

<ol id=list1>
	Today I fooled around with my homepage. I tried to make it kinda clean and I made two big blue buttons that always are the same size proportionally with the "vw" and "vh" things. I also added a new hover function for either button in JS.
</ol>

<h1 id=header1>Entry 7 -- Home Page Push</h1>

<ol id=list1>
Today I locked in and created a goated home page with molly + chatGPT's help, and I fixed my jumpscare thing. Now it's lame, but fully functional. Gonna try and push this all now. </ol>


<h1 id=header1>Entry 8 -- Clock</h1>

<ol id=list1>
Today I made a project using setInterval and appendChild. I wouldn't recommend you check it out, it's kind of a waste of time.</ol>

<h1 id=header2>Entry 9 -- Minor and miscellaneous changes</h1>

<ol id=list2>
Today I fixed the text on my homepage so it fills the two buttons and stays proportional to the size of the screen. I also got a new idea for my skullcode which might fix all my problems. I'm sure it will work on the first try and then I'll be happy forever. </ol>


<h2 id=header1>Entry 10 -- Else statements</h2>

<ol id =list1> The longer I am alive, the more confused I am. This week I became much more confused about many things. People don't make sense. Sometimes I feel like a computer. But then I went into CS class and I remembered that computers don't make sense either. So I guess we're all in the same boat. And I made a super basic project using else statements.
</ol>

<h2 id=header1>Entry 11-- Lessons</h2>

<ol id=list1>I am back, after a long time away from this CS1 journal. Today I feel like a grain of salt that has inadvertently been thrown into a very deep well. But anyways, Molly taught us a recap of what we've learned. I didn't know that when you create an element in javascript, it's really just putting a string in some brackets. The code doesn't 'know' that it's creating a div, or a header, or anything like that. Crazy Stuff.</ol>
